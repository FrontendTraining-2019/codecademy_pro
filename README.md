# My New Coding Journey II

<img src="https://realtoughcandy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Codecademy-front-end-engineer-career-path.png">

As I mentioned in my freeCodeCamp repo, for the new year I'm working on becoming a Front-End Web Developer by the end of the year. In order to complete this task I'm doing at least four certifications from freeCodeCamp. At the same time, I'm going to complete Codecademy Front-End Engineer Career Path as well. This Career Path will teach me the technologies that I will need to reach my goal and it'll cover a range of topics from HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, and Data Structures. Due to all the subjects covered, I'm going to use this repo to hold all of the various projects that I'll have to complete.
